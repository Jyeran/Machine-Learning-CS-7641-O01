You can access all code used in the assignment here: https://github.com/Jyeran/Machine-Learning-CS-7641-O01/tree/main/assignment%202

Package dependecies:
-sci-kit learn
-pandas
-numpy
-seaborn
-matplotlib
-six
-mlrose-hiive

Each algorithm is broken into a different python file. In order to run the entire analysis.

1. Download required packages.

2. Navigate to the assignment 2 folder

3. Run the desired python file
	-assignment2.py (baserun hyperparameter tuning and optimization for optimization problems)
	-assignment2nn.py (neural net optimization)
	-as1_nn.py (multilayer perceptron training)
	-assignment2ProblemSize.py (growing sample size optimization)

4. View each output chart as the file runs. Note, many additional charts are generated in these scripts than were able to be fit into the analysis.

Note: It will likely take many hours to execute all of the code here.
