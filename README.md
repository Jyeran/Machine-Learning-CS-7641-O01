# Machine-Learning-CS-7641-O01 Assignment 1
You can access all code used in the assignment here: https://github.com/Jyeran/Machine-Learning-CS-7641-O01.git

Package dependecies:
-sci-kit learn
-pandas
-numpy
-seaborn
-matplotlib

Each algorithm is broken into a different python file. In order to run the entire analysis.

1. Download required packages.

2. Navigate to the assignment 1 folder

3. Run the desired python file
	-as1.py (decision trees and boosted trees)
	-as1_knn.p (k nearest neighbors)
	-as1_nn.py (multilayer perceptron)
	-as1_svm.py (support vector machine)
	-as1_curveTime.py (learning curves and times)

4. View each output chart as the file runs. Note, many additional charts are generated in these scripts than were able to be fit into the analysis.

Note: as1.py, knn.py, as1_nn.py, and as1_curveTime.py all take a significant amount of time to run.
